# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application
-
This is the first application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

BTW this is the formatting language "Markdown"

the hash sign at the top creates a top level heading

astericks create italic letter

brackets with url create a link

because this is a markdown file, we have to give it the right extension for a markdown file by moving the README file with 

git mv README.rdoc README.markdown

this changes the README.rdoc file to README.markdown file
